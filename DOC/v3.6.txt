so @v3.2.txt was our direction

we need to improve our wizard 

we need way more steps,

basically every single @core.js business rule we have @BUSINESS_RULES.md 
we should give it a dedicated step in our workflow wizard

its purpose is to give the operator user clear view of every single calculation
even if the user just have to sit and view the step and the step dont need user action

for our setting configs that are involve in the workflow

we should have one overview of the current configs settings, at the start as one of the first steps,

and then as we go, in every step that has config settings involved, we should show it as editable, just like how user can currently change config

and just as we have it that would take over and it be the latest config value for others moving forward

and again just like our current plan each payslip would have meta data for all the configs values that the payslip was calculated based on

since configs can change
thisa is similar to what we want in the end of the wizard workflow to have both a summary short one and a detailed one with configs value and everything
