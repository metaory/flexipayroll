we dont like many html markup nesting, 
we like to keep the dom nesting levels to minimum
css grid layout helps with having fewer dom element nesting

feel free to move, remove, rename, combine, create files

we overall like less files and less complexity

we like more functional and declarative code

look for outdated, unused, redundant, or other improvements
