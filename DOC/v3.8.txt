lets have improve our layout with keeping in mind our distraction free concept,

wi will have css grid layout for the page, on higher level we will have only three rows

the top row would be the header
the middle row would be the content,
the bottom row would be the footer with actions,  for example the wizard steps and buttons,

this whole thing wont have overflow y visible, 

the top and bottom rows would have fixed height and the middle container can have overflow y visible 

so the page wont have scrolls visible, but our middle container row can have scroll and we will be fine on any resolution
