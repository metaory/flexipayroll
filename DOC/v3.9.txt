lets review our files again

we want the app svelte to have some of its related code and style

the styles.sass should only be some resets, some theme variables and design tokens, and some global styles

and all other svelte components to have their own styles contained unless its shared style, in that case its ok to be in styles,

its ok if you want to create more svelte components or placeholders
